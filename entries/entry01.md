# Entry 1

As the indecisive and pessimistic person as I am, I don’t know what topic I should be choosing for my freedom project. As I looked into different topics that I can have my eyes set on, I started to feel reminiscent of a certain topic that I was fascinated when I was little: Hacking. I had a stepbrother that works for certain programming company that knows how to hack into computers and get certain data such as wifi password, etc. Although, he can get different information it made me realized that getting hacked wasn’t a fun experience even though it had caught my eyes and interested me. Hacking no longer interests me as a grew older but I would want to learn certain things that can come in handy be useful in a certain situation but being able to prevent getting hack became my priority. Cybersecurity immediately caught my eye where I want to looked into ways that you can do before you get hack or avoiding it in general. This can be provided usefulness to know ways you can protect yourself online and setting securities that can help you. This way I can prevent myself from getting hack and other people who have the same problems as me.


Cybersecurity is one of the biggest issues when your browsing through the internet, some information that you put or search up can be tracked by certain people if you aren’t being careful. To prevent these things some basic causation can be done such as choosing strong passwords, be wary of attachment on emails, and backing up data (Cybersecurity). These information are some stuff everyone should know about.

Currently, the skill I have honed and made sharper was by my researching and observation skills where I have to look up things to find my topic of cybersecurity. This skill is essential due to the fact that I’m able to crowdsource for information more efficiently and find the thing I’m looking for. Therefore, looking for a credible source would be an easier task for me to do rather than not knowing if the information is inaccurate.


The skills I learn are going to be important to be going into the future. As I continue this freedom project these skills will provide me with a lot of benefit by helping me look for evidence and information. This helps me learn by look for information that are reliable and his helped me learn how important data is going to be
